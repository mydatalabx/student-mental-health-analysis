# Student Mental Health Analysis

Analysis of international student mental health data to investigate how length of stay impacts mental health diagnostic scores and explore factors contributing to depression and stress.

## Overview
This project analyzes survey data from a Japanese international university (2018) to understand the mental health challenges faced by international students. The analysis investigates whether social connectedness and acculturative stress are predictive of depression, and examines how length of stay affects mental health outcomes.

## Research Question
Does going to university in a different country affect mental health? How does the length of stay impact mental health diagnostic scores among international students?

## Technologies Used
- SQL (PostgreSQL)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Data Analysis

## Dataset
Survey data from international students including:
- **PHQ-9 test** (`todep`) - Depression screening
- **SCS test** (`tosc`) - Social Connectedness Scale
- **ASISS test** (`toas`) - Acculturative Stress Scale
- Length of stay and demographic information

## Key Analysis
- Calculated average mental health diagnostic scores by length of stay
- Analyzed correlation between stay duration and mental health outcomes
- Examined the relationship between social connectedness, acculturative stress, and depression
- Identified patterns in international student mental health data

## Files
- `notebook.ipynb` - SQL analysis and findings
- `students.csv` - Student mental health survey data

## Key Findings
Analysis explores whether international students face higher mental health risks and if length of stay is a contributing factor to mental health outcomes.

Completed as part of DataCamp's SQL curriculum.
